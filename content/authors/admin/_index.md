Lyucheng Wu is an incoming Master’s student in Artificial Intelligence at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore, beginning August 2025. He is currently an undergraduate at Chu Kochen Honors College, Zhejiang University, majoring in Computer Science. His research interests lie in natural language processing, multimodal large language models, and safety-aligned model fine-tuning. He is a research assistant at the ZJU-Ant Group Joint Research Center for Knowledge Graphs, advised by Prof. Ningyu Zhang and Shumin Deng.

He led a gold-winning team in Huawei’s MindSpore Model Challenge, finetuned a LoRA-optimized LLM for mathematical reasoning, and co-authored the world’s first Chinese presupposition dataset during a research internship at the HPC-AI Lab, NUS. His recent work focuses on AutoSteer, a modular steering framework for safe MLLM inference without model fine-tuning. AutoSteer introduces a novel Safety Awareness Score, a lightweight safety prober, and a refusal head to reduce attack success rates while preserving general capabilities, and is documented in his first-author paper Automating Steering for Safe Multimodal Large Language Models(related [repo](https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoSteer)).
